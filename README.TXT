It is discussed in chapter 7.
PART 3:
27. Yes.
28. It resets the automaton to its initial state(number of cells, at state 0).
29.a)You have to add cells to the left and the right by adding/subtracting from the numberOfCells/2. To do this, I added a random number variable. 
   b) Different patterns emerge. They are not deterministic.
31. I think it's to differentiate between the current state and the next one. If we change nextState to state, it doesn't change anything.
32. By using the "this." keyword. I feel like my answer is easier since.
35.
